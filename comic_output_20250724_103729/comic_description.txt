This four-panel comic strip utilizes a clean, minimalist art style with bold outlines and bright, saturated colors, primarily featuring a palette of blues, whites, greens, and appliance-like silvers. The setting is a modern, stylized kitchen with simple geometric shapes. Panel one shows a stereotypical "otaku" character with messy hair, oversized glasses, and a slightly hunched posture, standing in front of a gleaming, futuristic-looking smart refrigerator. He's holding a bag of instant noodles and looking sheepish. A speech bubble from the refrigerator reads, "Seriously? Noodles again?" in a sarcastic font. Panel two focuses on the refrigerator's digital display panel. On the screen, a cartoonish broccoli icon scowls, and a text message is displayed: "Your vitamin intake is dangerously low!" The otaku is scratching his head in confusion. Panel three depicts the otaku attempting to sneak a can of soda into the refrigerator. The fridge's door has a small robotic arm extending out, blocking the can. A sound effect "Beep! Boop!" emanates from the arm as it pushes the soda can away. The otaku stares at the fridge with a defeated expression. The final panel shows the otaku reluctantly holding a plate of vegetables, looking disgusted. The refrigerator shines with a green light. The refrigerator's display panel now shows a smiling cartoon apple and a message: "Progress! But still needs work..." The otaku sighs deeply.
