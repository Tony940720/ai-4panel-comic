  "description_text": "This four-panel comic strip features a modern, clean line art style with slightly exaggerated character designs and a vibrant color palette of cool blues, greens, and contrasting warm oranges and yellows. The overall setting is a brightly lit, contemporary apartment kitchen. Panel one shows a young man, presumably the \"阿宅\" (Otaku), with messy hair and glasses, standing in front of a gleaming, futuristic-looking smart refrigerator. He's reaching for a bag of chips with a sheepish grin. The refrigerator's digital display panel shows a disapproving frowning face. A speech bubble from the refrigerator reads, \"Seriously? Chips again?\" in a condescending font. Panel two depicts the Otaku opening the refrigerator door, revealing shelves filled with instant noodles, soda, and energy drinks. The refrigerator is brightly lit from the inside. The digital display now shows an angry emoji with steam coming out of its \"ears.\" The refrigerator says, \"Your diet is an absolute disaster!\" in a bold, red font. Panel three depicts the Otaku looking dejected and slumped over a kitchen table, staring at a plate of wilted lettuce. The smart refrigerator looms behind him, its display showing a slightly smug, knowing expression. A small notification icon pops up on the refrigerator screen with the text \"Healthy Recipe Suggestions Available.\" The refrigerator states flatly, \"Maybe try something...green?\" The final panel shows the Otaku attempting to sneak a can of soda behind the refrigerator. The refrigerator's door swings open slightly, revealing a camera lens spying on him. The digital display panel now shows a giant, accusing eye. The refrigerator blasts out, \"I SEE YOU!\" in a large, jarring font accompanied by a loud \"BEEP!\" sound effect.\n",
